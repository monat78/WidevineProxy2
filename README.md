# WidevineProxy2
An extension-based proxy for Widevine EME challenges and license messages. \
Modifies the challenge before it reaches the web player and retrieves the decryption keys from the response.

## Features
+ User-friendly / GUI-based
+ Bypasses one-time tokens, hashes, and license wrapping
+ JavaScript native Widevine implementation
+ Supports Widevine Device files
+ Manifest V3 compliant

## Widevine Devices
This addon requires a Widevine Device file to work, which is not provided by this project.
+ Use an existing Remote CDM like [this one](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21834836/remote.json)
+ Follow [this](https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/408031) guide if you want to dump your own device.
+ Ready-to-use Widevine Devices can be found on the [VideoHelp forum](https://forum.videohelp.com/forums/48).

## Compatibility
+ Compatible (tested) browsers: Firefox/Chrome on Windows/Linux.
+ Works with any service that accepts challenges from Android devices on the same endpoint.

  + Temporary installation
    1. Download the ZIP file from the [releases section](https://github.com/DevLARLEY/WidevineProxy2/releases)
    2. Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
    3. Click `Load Temporary Add-on...` and select the downloaded file

## Setup
### Widevine Device
If you only have a `device_client_id_blob` and `device_private_key`, run this command to create a .wvd file:
```
pywidevine create-device -k device_private_key -c device_client_id_blob -t "ANDROID" -l 3
```
Now, open the extension, click `Choose File` and select your Widevine Device file.

### Remote CDM
If you don't already have a `remote.json` file, open the API URL in the browser (if provided) and save the response as `remote.json`. \
Now, open the extension, click `Choose remote.json` and select the JSON file provided by your API.


+ Select the type of device you're using in the top right-hand corner
+ The files are saved in the extension's `chrome.storage.sync` storage and will be synchronized across any browsers into which the user is signed in with their Google account.
+ The maximum number of Widevine devices is ~25 **OR** ~200 Remote CDMs
+ Check `Enabled` to activate the message interception and you're done.

## Usage
All the user has to do is to play a DRM protected video and the decryption keys should appear in the `Keys` group box (if the service is not unsupported, as stated above). \
Keys are saved:
+ Temporarily until the extension is either refreshed manually (if installed temporarily) or a removal of the keys is manually initiated.
+ Permanently in the extension's `chrome.storage.local` storage until manually wiped or exported via the command line.
> [!NOTE]  
> The video will not play when the interception is active, as the Widevine CDM library isn't able to decrypt the Android CDM license.

+ Click the `+` button to expand the section to reveal the PSSH and keys.

## FAQ
> What if I'm unable to get the keys?

This automatically means that the license server is blocking your CDM and that you either need a CDM from a physical device, a ChromeCDM, or an L1 Android CDM. Don't ask where you can get these

## Issues
+ DRM playback won't work when the extension is disabled and EME Logger is active. This is caused by my fix for dealing with EME Logger interference (solutions are welcome).
